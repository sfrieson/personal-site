1. Resume
  - AudienceView (highlight)
    I was hired near the beginning of the redesign of the TheaterMania and WhatsOnStage brands' websites––two website driven by the same codebase and some clever configuration. I was invited to the small team for my React and frontend experience where the rest of the team were mainly PHP full stack developers. Helping our team get to launch, I became the de facto lead for the website (Next.js, styled-components, Apollo client, Node.js) and the API (Apollo server, ElasticSearch, Node.js).

  - RW3
    RW3's CultureWizard is an e-learning platform teaching and supplying information about culture as it relates to the workplace for 160 countries. As their sole frontend developer, I developed the redesign of the platform using React, Redux, and Sass, incorporating the legacy materials into the new experience. After completion, I designed and developed new features to continue where the redesign left off.
  - General Assembly
    The Web Development Immersive is a 3 month course which prepared me to be a front end developer. The course supplied hands-on experiences start with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It progressed through Ruby frameworks (Sinatra, Ruby on Rails) and JavaScript frameworks (Angular 1, MEAN stack). Along the way we learn about git, GitHub, SQL, NoSQL.

  - Graphic Design
    Before development, I held a couple jobs and freelanced for several clients doing graphic design. My longest tenure was at New York Cares where I was in charge of all of their print design for small products like postcards and handouts through more upscale items like gala invitations and Times Square billboards. I managed client relations and expectations keeping projects on budget and on time.
  - New York University
    The Gallatin School at NYU allowed me to design my own independent study focused on creativity. Through the course I combined my interests in many different art forms (music, photography, writing, knitting) and honed in on the creative process and demistifying it. I was not only introduced to new forms of art (dance, painting) but also ideas (Theory of Forms) as well.
