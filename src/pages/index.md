<p class="color--display fontWeight--bold fontSize--6">Hi!</p>
<p class="color--display fontWeight--bold fontSize--4">I am Steven.</p>

Welcome to my website. This is my small corner of the internet, which I'm filling with some stuff I care about. Considering I am a web developer by profession, most of the content here will slant that direction, but I can't promise that I won't deviate from that topic.

More specifically, I'm a front end developer working predominantly in the web technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I also care greatly about solving problems for people whether that be end users on a website or fellow developers.

I hope this website can be informative for you. Continue to check back because, as most things in development, this site is an iterative process.

Steven ðŸ˜œ
