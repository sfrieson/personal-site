              I am a web developer, and I made this website. It is made with the three
              core web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. If you would like to learn
              about more of the technologies driving this site, see the colophon.
            </p>
            <p>
              This website is meant to give you an idea of who I am, how I got to
              where I am today, and display what I do as a developer. This site is
              also meant to be informative, showing some things I'm interested in and
              maybe teaching you something along the way. It's meant to be fun, so I
              hope you enjoy the interactive bits. Finally it's for everyone. If
              something about this site is hard for you to use, please tell me.

                opportunity to travel all over the world. Here's some of the places
                I've been.

                  All throughout school I was known for being musical. I can play
                  several instruments and sing. The first instrument I learned and the
                  one I still play the most often is the piano.

                  In college a friend taught me the basics of crocheting. From there I
                  continued to learn more and then taught myself how to knit. Some
                  other fiber arts that I've tried are sewing and spinning yarn. I'd
                  also like to try embroidery and weaving.

                  I became very interested in photography in middle school. I've taken
                  both film and digital photography classes in high school and
                  college. This is what introduced me to Adobe Photoshop and the rest
                  of the Adobe Creative Suite.

                  technologies since high school, but going to General Assembly taught
                  me solid foundations to break into a new industry.

                <p>
                  Since finishing <abbr title="General Assembly">GA</abbr>, I've had a
                  few tech jobs. The focus of each job has been very different, but
                  the front end technologies at each have centered around React.

                  <h4>RW3</h4>
                  <p>
                    At my first tech job, I was the sole front end developer, and was
                    charged with the task of implementing the redesign of their
                    flagship e-learning software CultureWizard.

                  <p>
                    My next experience was a similar one. I joined their small team at
                    the beginning of a redesign of
                    <a href="https://www.theatermania.com" rel="noofollower noopener"
                      >their website</a
                    >, which publishes theater news and sells tickets. At
                    TheaterMania, I gained experience in a few backend technologies
                    like GraphQL and ElasticSearch, as well as deepening my front end
                    skills with performance, SEO, and ad service.

                    My current job has been a big change for me, in that it's the
                    first time I've worked on a medium-sized engineering team and on
                    enterprise software in the business/finance sector. I've worked on
                    feature teams, but also championed multiple successful efforts
                    around code quality and developer experience.
